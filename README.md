## Introduction
The project was part of analyzing A/B Test Results section of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. Through the project you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

#### Before submitting
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it meets the expectations in the rubric. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that focuses on the quality of your code. It is not just important that you are able to obtain the correct answers, but it is also important that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.
